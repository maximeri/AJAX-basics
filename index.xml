// XML, extensible markup language
// structured data format is designed to deal with large data. It should be ordered consistently, with identifiers(what it is), and is easy for JS to analyze and use
// Two common data exchange formats: XML vs JSON
// XML allows you to create your own tag than HTML
<contacts>
  <contact><contact>
  </contacts>
// The benefit of structured data like XML makes parsing (process of breaking a file up into easily accessed parts)easy. 
// XML is commonly used to exchanging data between computers. Most server-side language handles XML easily. 
// But it doesn't work so well with JS, therefore JSON is preferred for AJAX responses format
